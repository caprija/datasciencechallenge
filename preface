This extesnsion follows the same conventions as OCHP:

The key words must, must not, required, shall, shall not, should, should not, recommended, may and optional in this document are to be interpreted as described in [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119](RFC 2119).

The cardinality is defined by the indicators *, +, ? and 1, where the last one is the default. The meaning and mapping to XML syntax is as follows:

Meaning	XML Schema	DTD
At most one	minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1"	?
one or more	minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="unbounded"	+
zero or more	minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"	*
exactly one	(default)	1
For some data fields a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression is provided as an additional but very precise definition of the data format.
